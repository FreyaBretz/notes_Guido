\begin{remark}
  This part of the notes deals with preconditioning of symmetric
  operators, or those, which have a dominating symmetric part. The
  theory of preconditioning methods for nonsymmetric and in particular
  non-normal operators is currently not well developed and thus will not
  be covered by these notes. 
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  While the methods developed in this chapter are fairly general, we
  introduce a specific model problem as a simple benchmark case. To
  this end, we consider the Dirichlet problem: find $u\in V =
  H^1_0(\Omega)$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:itintro:1}
    a(u,v) \equiv \int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot \nabla v \dx
    = \int_\Omega f v \dx \equiv f(v),
    \qquad \forall v\in V.
  \end{gather}
  The finite dimensional linear systems of equations are derived from
  finite element discretizations on quasi-uniform meshes of cells with
  maximal diameter $h$, yielding a sequence of spaces $V_h$, on which
  linear systems are introduced by the same weak
  form~\eqref{eq:itintro:1}.
\end{example}

\begin{notation}
  With a bilinear form $a(.,.)$ on $V\times V$ we associate the
  operator $A: V\to V^*$ by
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:itintro:2}
    \scal(Au,v) = a(u,v), \quad \forall v\in V,
  \end{gather}
  where $\scal(.,.):V^*\times V \to \R$ is the canonical bilinear form of an
  element of $V^*$ and an element of $V$, namely
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:richardson:9}
    \scal(f,v) = f(v), \quad \forall f\in V^*, v\in V.
  \end{gather}
  
  We will tacitly assume that operators $A$, $B$, etc.\ are defined by
  equation~\eqref{eq:itintro:2} and the bilinear forms $a(.,.)$,
  $b(.,.)$, etc., respectively, if they are not defined otherwise.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}
  We call the bilinear form $a(.,.)$ \define{symmetric} and its
  associated operator $A$ self-adjoint, if there holds
  \begin{gather*}
    a(u,v) = a(v,u) \qquad \forall u,v \in V.
  \end{gather*}
  They are called \define{elliptic}, if for there is a positive number
  $\gamma$ such that
  \begin{gather*}
    a(u,u) \ge \gamma \norm{u}_V^2 \qquad \forall u\in V.
  \end{gather*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  \defindex{Lambdaa@$\Lambda(A)$}
  \defindex{lambdaa@$\lambda(A)$}
  For positive definite self adjoint operators, we obtain the possibly
  infinite bounds of the spectrum
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:richardson:8}
    \Lambda(A) = \sup_{u\in V}\frac{a(u,u)}{\norm{u}_V^2},
    \qquad
    \lambda(A) = \inf_{u\in V}\frac{a(u,u)}{\norm{u}_V^2},
  \end{gather}
  \defindex{kappaa@$\kappa(A)$}
  \index{condition number|see {spectral condition number}}
  as well as the possibly infinite \define{spectral condition number}
  \begin{gather*}
   \kappa(A) = \frac{\Lambda(A)}{\lambda(A)}.
  \end{gather*}
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
  Note that the spectral condition number depends on the norm of the
  space $V$. It is bounded, if and only if $A$ is bounded with respect
  to this norm.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
  Let $V=H^1_0(\Omega)$ with the inner product
  \begin{gather*}
    \scal(u,v)_1 = \int_\Omega \nabla u\cdot \nabla v \dx.  
  \end{gather*}
  If $A$ is the operator associated with the bilinear form $a(.,.)$
  in~\eqref{eq:itintro:1}, then 
  \begin{gather*}
    \Lambda(A) = \lambda(A) = \kappa(A) = 1.    
  \end{gather*}
  If on the other hand $V = L^2(\Omega)$ equipped with the usual
  $L^2$-inner product, then $A$ is unbounded and thus $\kappa(A) =
  \infty$. $\lambda(A)$ is the constant in Friedrichs' inequality.
\end{example}

\begin{notation}
  After choosing a basis for a finite dimensional space $V_n$ or a
  Schauder basis for the space $V$ (assuming $V$ separable), say
  $\{\phi_i\}$, we can define a (possibly infinite-dimensional) matrix
  $\mat A$ associated with the bilinear form $a(.,.)$ with the entries
  \begin{gather*}
    a_{i j} = a(\phi_j, \phi_i).
  \end{gather*}
  
  If we restrict the bilinear forms to a finite dimensional subspace
  $V_n$, we denote the matrices $\mat A$ restricted to this subspace
  by $\mat A_n$.
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}
  \defindex{Lambdama@$\Lambda(\mat A)$}
  \defindex{lambdama@$\lambda(\mat A)$}
  The two extremal eigenvalues of the matrix $\mat A_n$ can be
  obtained by the maximum and minimum of the \define{Rayleigh
    quotient}
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:itintro:3}
    \Lambda(\mat A) = \max_{\vec x\in \R^n}\frac{\vec x^T \mat A \vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x},
    \qquad
    \lambda(\mat A) = \min_{\vec x\in \R^n}\frac{\vec x^T \mat A \vec x}{\vec x^T\vec x}.
  \end{gather}
  \defindex{kappama@$\kappa(\mat A)$}
  The \putindex{spectral condition number} is
  \begin{gather*}
    \kappa(\mat A) = \frac{\Lambda(\mat A)}{\lambda(\mat A)}.
  \end{gather*}
\end{definition}

\begin{note}
  The spectral condition number of the operator $A$ depends on the
  bilinear form $a(.,.)$ and the choice of the norm in $V$. On the
  other hand, the spectral condition number of the matrix $\mat A$
  depends on the choice of a basis of the space $V_n$.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
  Let $\{\phi_i\}$ be the standard, piecewise linear, finite element
  basis on a quasi-uniform triangulation of mesh size $h$. Let $\mat
  M$, the so called \define{mass matrix} be the matrix associated with
  the $L^2$-inner product. It has the entries
  \begin{gather*}
    m_{ij} = \int_\Omega \phi_i(x) \phi_j(x) \dx.
  \end{gather*}
  It is easy to verify, that $m_{ii}> 0$, and that not more
  entries in each row as edges of the triangulation meet in one vertex
  are different from zero. Furthermore, that the size of those entries
  is of order $h^d$, where $d$ is the space dimension. From these two
  facts we immediately obtain
  \begin{gather*}
    \Lambda(\mat M) = \mathcal O(h^{d}).
  \end{gather*}
  The argument for $\lambda(\mat M)$ is more subtle. For any mesh cell
  $T$, let $\vec x_T$ be the entries of the vector $\vec x$ which
  belong to node values of the cell $T$. Let $\mat M_T$ be the cell
  mass matrix obtained by restricting the $L^2$-inner product to
  $T$. Then,
  \begin{gather*}
    \vec x^T \mat M \vec x
    = \sum_{T\in\T_h} \vec x^T_T \mat M_T \vec x_T
    \ge \min_{T\in\T_h} \frac{\vec x^T_T \mat M_T \vec x_T}{\vec
      x^T_T\vec x_T}
    \sum_{T\in\T_h} |\vec x_T|^2 \ge \lambda(\mat M_T)  |\vec x|^2.
  \end{gather*}
  In order to estimate the eigenvalues of $\mat M_T$, we note that for
  a unisolvent element, the norms $|\vec x_T|$ and $\|u\|_{0,T}$ are
  equivalent on the reference cell, and the $L^2$-norm scales with
  $h^d$ when transforming to the real cell $T$. Thus, we have
  $\lambda(\mat M) = \mathcal O(h^{d})$.
  Therefore, the condition number is
  \begin{gather*}
    \kappa(\mat M) = \frac{\mathcal O(h^{d})}{\mathcal O(h^{d})} = {\mathcal O(1)}.
  \end{gather*}
\end{example}

\begin{note}
  A closer inspection of the proof yields, that on a shape regular
  triangulation with cell radii rnaging between the minimum $h$ and
  the maximum $H$, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \Lambda(\mat M) &= \mathcal O(H^{d}) \\
    \lambda(\mat M) &= \mathcal O(h^{d}) \\
    \kappa(\mat M) &= \mathcal O\left(\left(\frac Hh\right)^{d}\right)
  \end{align*}
