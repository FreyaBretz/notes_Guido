\begin{intro}
  \putindex{multigrid} Multigrid methods avoid the problems discussed
  in the section on two-level Schwarz methods by using not only two,
  but a whole hierarchy of mesh levels. On each level, an approximate
  solver, a so called smoother is employed, which improves the error
  somewhat, and then an approximation on a coarser level is used to
  improve further. This is done down to the coarsest level, where we
  assume that the solution process is cheap.
\end{intro}

\begin{definition}
  A \define{hierarchy of spaces} $\{V_\ell\}_0\le \ell \le L$ is a
  sequence of the form
  \begin{gather}
    V_0 \subset V_1 \subset \dots \subset V_L.
  \end{gather}
  We assume that $V_L = V$ is the high resolution space on which we
  want to solve~\eqref{eq:itintro:1}, but where the condition number
  of the matrix $\mat A$ is bad. On the other end of the spectrum, we
  assume that the solution of~\eqref{eq:itintro:1} on $V_0$ is easily
  possible.
\end{definition}
