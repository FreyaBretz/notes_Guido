\begin{Definition}{polar-space}
  Let $W\subset V$ be a subspace of a Hilbert space $V$. We define its
  \define{polar space} $W^0\subset V^*$ by
  \begin{gather}
    \begin{split}
      \polar{W} &= \bigl\{f\in V^* \big| \scal(f,w)_{V^*\times V} = 0
      \;\forall\,w\in W\bigr\},
    \end{split}
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma}{polar-closed}
  The polar space $\polar W$ of a subspace $W\subset V$ are both
  closed.  The the orthogonal complement $\ortho W$ of a subspace
  $W\subset V$ is closed.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Consider the mapping
  \begin{align*}
    \Phi_w\colon V^* &\to \R,\\
    v&\mapsto \scal(v,w)_{V^*\times V}.
  \end{align*}
  For any $w$, the kernel of $\phi$ is closed as
  the pre-image of a closed set. $W^0$ is closed since it is the
  intersection of these kernels for all $w\in W$.
\end{proof}
