This text is part of a set of notes I prepared for students and
researchers. They mainly serve the purpose to be short and concise
introductions to mathematical topics. They are provided as is and in
the hope that they are useful. Nevertheless, I am always thankful for
possible corrections and suggestions for enhancements.

The material in these notes is not my original research. Most of it is
adapted from textbooks and research publications. While I am striving
to give credit to the original authors wherever possible, I will be
delighted to include more citations, also in order to improve the
value of these notes as a reference.

Finally, if you find these notes useful for your own research and
decide to cite results from them, I would be most flattered if you
decided to cite them as
