\section*{\centering List of relevant topics for the oral examination on ``Finite Element Methods for Flow Simulations''}

\textit{Part A} will be mandatory as starting point for the
examination. For the main part, the candidate can select \textit{Part B} or \textit{Part C}. Here is an overview:
\begin{itemize}
\item The short \textit{Part A} of the examination will focus on the modeling of flows, covers Section 1-2, and serves
as starting point.
\item \textit{Part B} will be concerned with the analysis and numerics of linear flow problems. It covers
Section 3-9 of the script.
\item The remaining \textit{Part C} will be devoted to the analysis and numerics of nonlinear flow and covers
Section 10-13 of the script.
