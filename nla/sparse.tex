\begin{Definition}{sparse-matrix}
  We call a matrix \textbf{sparse}\index{sparse matrix} in strict
  sense, if the number of nonzero entries is much less than the total
  number of entries, typically $\bigo(n)$ instead of $\bigo(n^2)$. The
  distribution of nonzero entries is called \define{sparsity pattern}.

  More broadly, a sparse matrix has the property that its application
  to a vector requires considerably less than $n^2$, typically
  $\bigo(n)$ operations. It also can be stored with considerably less
  than $n^2$ floating point numbers.

\begin{Example*}{page-rank}{The PageRank Algorithm}
  The page rank of a web page is computed from the Google Matrix
  \begin{gather}
    P = d (\matl+\vw \mathbf 1^T) + \tfrac{(1-d)}{n} \id,
  \end{gather}
  where $d \in (0,1)$ is a damping parameter, $\mathbf 1^T = (1,\dots,1)$,
  \begin{gather}
    l_{ij} =
    \begin{cases}
      \nicefrac1{c_i} & \text{if $i$ links to $j$}\\0&\text{else} 
    \end{cases},
    \qquad
    w_i =
    \begin{cases}
      1 &\text{if } c_i=1\\
      0&\text{else}
    \end{cases},
  \end{gather}
  and $c_i$ is the number of links from page $i$.

\begin{Example*}{csr}{Compressed row storage (CSR)}
  A sparse matrix can be stored using two integer fields defining the
  sparsity pattern and a field of floating point values for its
  entries. Let \lstinline!n! be the dimension of the matrix and
  \lstinline!n_nonzero! the total number of nonzero entries.
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    import numpy as np
    row_start = np.empty(n, dtype=np.uint)
    column = np.empty(n_nonzero, dtype=np.uint)
    entries = np.emtpy(n_nonzero, dtype=np.double)
  \end{lstlisting}

  The operation $\vy=\mata\vx$ is then implemented as
  \begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
    for i in range(0,n):
    y[i] = 0.
    for j in range (row_start[i],row_start[i+1):
      y[i] += entries[j]*x[column[j]]
  \end{lstlisting}  
\end{Example*}

\begin{Remark}{algorithmic-matrix}
  In cases where the sparsity pattern and the entries of a matrix are
  known at compile time, a compressed stored matrix can be substituted
  by an algorithm performing the multiplication.

  Thus, we start viewing matrices more as linear operators than as
  rectangular schemes of numbers.
