\begin{intro}
  In this section, we develop error estimates of the following type
  \begin{verse}
    If the size of mesh cells converges to zero, then the difference
    between the true solution and the finite element solution
    converges to zero with a certain order.
  \end{verse}
  They are thus a prediction, that the solutions actually converge,
  and they measure the asymptotic convergence rate. They do contain unknown constants, such that they are no prediction of the error on a given mesh.
\end{intro}

\subsection{Approximation of Sobolev spaces by finite elements}

\begin{Lemma*}{poincare}{Poincaré inequality}
  Let $\domain$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any function
  $u\in H^1(\domain)$ define
  \begin{gather}
    \overline u = \frac1{\abs{\domain}} \int_\domain u(\vx) \dvx,
  \end{gather}
  where $\abs{\domain}$ denotes the measure of $\domain$. There exists
  a constant $c$ depending on the domain only, such that each of the
  following inequalities hold:
  \begin{align}
    \norm{u-\overline u}_{L^2(\domain)} &\le c \norm{\nabla u}_{L^2(\domain)}\\
    \norm{u}_{L^2(\domain)}^2 &\le c \Bigl(\norm{\nabla u}_{L^2(\domain)}^2 + \overline u^2\Bigr)
  \end{align}
\end{Lemma*}

\begin{proof}
  The proof exceeds the tools we have developed in this class. The
  proof in \cite[Section 7.8]{GilbargTrudinger98} seems elementary and
  direct, but is technical and requires star-shaped domains. The proof
  in \cite[Section 5.8.1]{Evans98} is more elegant, but it uses
  compact embedding and is indirect, such that the constant cannot be
  determined.
\end{proof}

\begin{Lemma*}{bramble-hilbert}{Bramble-Hilbert}
  Let $\cell\subset \R^d$ be a domain with Lipschitz boundary and let
  $s(.)$ be a bounded sublinear functional on $H^{k+1}(\cell)$ with
  the property
  \begin{gather}
    s(p) = 0 \qquad\forall p\in \P_k.
  \end{gather}
  Then, there exists a constant $c$ only dependent on $\cell$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    \abs{s(v)} \le c \snorm{v}_{k+1,\cell}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Lemma*}

\begin{proof}
  Since $s(\cdot)$ is sublinear and vanishes on $\P_k$, we have for
  $v\in H^{k+1}(\cell)$:
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:bramble-hilbert-1}
    \abs{s(v)} \le \abs{s(v+p)} + \abs{s(p)} = \abs{s(v+p)}
    \qquad\forall p\in\P_k.
  \end{gather}
  We will construct a polynomial, such that
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:bramble-hilbert-2}
    \overline{\d^\alpha(v+p)}
    = \frac1{\abs{\cell}}\int_\cell \d^\alpha (v+p) \dx = 0
    \qquad\forall \abs{\alpha} \le k,
  \end{gather}
  that is, the sum $v+p$ and all its derivatives up to order $k$ are
  mean-value free. Thus, by recursive application of Poincaré
  inequality, we get for $\abs{\alpha}\le k$
  \begin{alignat*}2
    \norm{v+p}_{L^2(\cell)}^2
    &\le c \left[ \norm{\nabla(v+p)}_{L^2(\cell)}^2 + \overline{v+p}^2\right]
      && \le c \snorm{v+p}_{1;\cell}^2\\
    \norm{\d^\alpha(v+p)}_{L^2(\cell)}^2,
    &\le c \left[ \norm{\nabla\d^\alpha(v+p)}_{L^2(\cell)}^2
      + \overline{\d^\alpha(v+p)}^2\right]
      && \le c \snorm{v+p}_{\abs{\alpha}+1;\cell}^2,
  \end{alignat*}
  such that $\norm{v+p}_{k+1;\cell} \le \snorm{v+p}_{k+1;\cell}$.
  Furthermore, since $p\in\P_k$
  \begin{gather*}
    \norm{\d^\alpha(v+p)}_{L^2(\cell)} = \norm{\d^\alpha v}_{L^2(\cell)}
    \qquad\forall \abs{\alpha} = k+1.
  \end{gather*}
  Combining with~\eqref{eq:bramble-hilbert-1}, we obtain
  \begin{gather*}
    \abs{s(v)} \le c \snorm{v+p}_{k+1;\cell} \le c \snorm{v}_{k+1;\cell}.
  \end{gather*}
  It remains to construct the polynomial $p$ with the desired
  properties. To this end, we note that for two multi-indices $\alpha$
  and $\beta$ holds that $\d^\alpha \vx^\beta =0$ as soon as
  $\alpha_i>\beta_i$ for some index $i$. Let
  \begin{gather*}
    p(\vx) = \sum_{\abs{\beta}\le k} a_\beta \vx^\beta.
  \end{gather*}
  Then, for any $\abs{\alpha} = k$ we get
  \begin{gather*}
    \d^\alpha p(\vx) = \alpha! \,\delta_{\alpha\beta},
  \end{gather*}
  where $\alpha! = \alpha_1!\alpha_2!\dots\alpha_d!$. Thus, we can use
  condition~\eqref{eq:bramble-hilbert-2} to fix the coefficients
  $a_\beta$ to
  \begin{gather*}
    a_\beta = \frac1{\beta!\,\abs{\cell}} \int_\cell \d^\beta v\dx
    \qquad \abs{\beta} = k.
  \end{gather*}
  Thus, we have decomposed $p = \tilde p_k + p_{k-1}$, where
  $\tilde p_k$ is known and $p_{k-1}\in \P_{k-1}$. Thus, we can repeat
  the process determining the coefficients of highest order in
  $p_{k-1}$,
  \begin{gather*}
    a_\beta = \frac1{\beta!\,\abs{\cell}} \int_\cell \d^\beta (v-\tilde p_k)\dx
    \qquad \abs{\beta} = k-1.
  \end{gather*}
  Recursion down to $k=0$ yields the polynomial $p$ with the desired property.
\end{proof}

\begin{Corollary}{b-h-projector}
  Let $\Pi\colon H^{k+1}(\cell) \to \P_k$ be a continuous, linear
  projector. For any $m\le k$ there exists a constant $c$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{u-\Pi u}_{m,\cell} \le c \snorm{u}_{k+1,\cell}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Corollary}

\begin{Definition}{mesh-family}
  Let $\{\mesh_h\}$ for $h>0$ be a family of meshes parametrized by
  the parameter
  \begin{gather}
    h = \max_{\cell\in\mesh_h} h_\cell,
  \end{gather}
  where $h_\cell$ is the characteristic length from the discussion of
  mappings, for instance the diameter of $\cell$. Such a family is
  called \define{shape regular}, if the constants $M_\cell$,
  $m_\cell$, $d_\cell$, and $D_\cell$ in the scaling lemma
  can be chosen independent of the cell $\cell\in\mesh_h$ and of
  $h>0$. The family is called \define{quasi-uniform}, if in addition
  there is a positive constant independent of $h$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    h \le c \min_{\cell\in\mesh_h} h_\cell.
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}{nodal-interpolation}
  Let $V$ be a function space on $\domain$, and let
  $V_h = V_{\mesh_h}$ be a finite element space on the mesh $\mesh_h$
  on $\domain$ with node functionals $\nodal_i$ and dual basis $p_i$,
  where $i=1,\dots,n_h$. We define the \define{nodal interpolation}
  operator by
  \begin{gather}
    \begin{split}
      I_h\colon V&\to V_h\\
      v &\mapsto \sum \nodal_i(v)p_i.
    \end{split}
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma}{nodal-interpolation}
  The nodal interpolation operator $I_h$ is a projector. It is
  continuous on $H^2(\domain)$ if the dimension is $d=2,3$ and the
  node functionals are defined as Lagrange interpolation.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Definition}{broken-sobolev-norm}
  On a mesh $\mesh_h$, we define the \define{broken Sobolev norm} and
  seminorm by
  \begin{gather}
    \begin{split}
      \norm{u}_{k;h}^2 &= \sum_{\cell\in\mesh_h} \norm{u}_{k;\cell}^2\\
      \snorm{u}_{k;h}^2 &= \sum_{\cell\in\mesh_h} \snorm{u}_{k;\cell}^2
    \end{split}
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Theorem}{fe-interpolation}
  Let $\{\mesh_h\}$ be a shape regular family of meshes.
  Let the finite element spaces $V_h = V_{\mesh_h}$. Let the nodal
  interpolation operator $I_h$ be surjective onto $\P_k$ on every cell
  $\cell\in\mesh_h$ and continuous on $H^{k+1}(\domain)$. Then, there
  is a constant $c$ such that for any $u\in H^{k+1}(\domain)$ and
  $m\le k+1$ there holds
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{u-I_h u}_{m;h} \le c h^{k+1-m} \snorm{u}_{k+1;h}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We have by definition
  \begin{gather*}
    \snorm{u-I_h u}_{m;h} = \sum_{\cell\in\mesh_h} \snorm{u-I_h u}_{m;\cell}.
  \end{gather*}
  Using the scaling lemma, we get
  \begin{gather*}
    \snorm{u-I_h u}_{m;\cell}
    \le c h_\cell^{\nicefrac d2-m} \snorm{\refu - \widehat{I_hu}}.
  \end{gather*}
  On the reference cell, we use the Bramble-Hilbert lemma, more
  precisely, \slideref{Corollary}{b-h-projector} to obtain
  \begin{gather*}
    \snorm{\refu - \widehat{I_hu}} \le c \snorm{\refu}_{k+1;\refcell}.
  \end{gather*}
  Scaling back yields
  \begin{gather*}
    \snorm{\refu}_{k+1;\refcell}
    \le c h_\cell^{k+1-\nicefrac d2} \snorm{u}_{k+1;\cell}.
  \end{gather*}
  Combining, we obtain
  \begin{gather*}
    \snorm{u-I_h u}_{m;\cell} \le c h_\cell^{k+1-\nicefrac d2 - m +
      \nicefrac d2}\snorm{u}_{k+1;\cell}.
  \end{gather*}
  Summing up and pulling the maximum of $h_\cell^{k+1-m}$ out of the
  sum yields the result for $h_\cell \le 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  Strictly speaking, we have only proven the result for $h_T \le
  1$.
  But then, if $\diam\domain = 1$, this condition is always
  true. Therefore, by rescaling the domain before computing, the
  estimate holds in general.
\end{remark}

\begin{Corollary}{fe-approximation}
  Let $a(.,.)$ be a bounded and elliptic bilinear form on
  $V\subset H^1(\domain)$ and let the
  assumptions of the \slideref{Theorem}{fe-interpolation} hold. If
  furthermore the solution $u\in H^{k+1}(\domain)$, the error between
  the exact and the finite element solution to a uniquely solvable
  elliptic boundary value problem, admits the estimate
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{u-u_h}_{1;h} \le c h^{k} \snorm{u}_{k+1;h}.
  \end{gather}  
\end{Corollary}

\begin{intro}
  For 2nd order elliptic problems, we have now derived estimates of
  the $H^1$-norm of the error under the assumption that the solution
  exhibits further regularity. Now, let us drop this assumptionfor an
  assumption on the boundary condition only, to obtain a qualitative
  convergence result.
\end{intro}

\begin{Theorem}{fe-convergence}
  Let $\domain\subset \R^d$ be polyhedral. Let the solution space
  $V\subset H^1(\domain)$ be such that $H^2(\domain)$ is dense in V
  with respect to the $H^1$-norm. Let $\{\mesh_h\}$ be a quasi-uniform
  family of meshes with finite element spaces $V_h\subset V$. Let
  $u\in V$ and $u_h\in V_h$ be solutions to the exact and the finite
  element versions of a 2nd order boundary value problem. Then,
  \begin{gather}
    \lim_{h\searrow 0} \norm{u-u_h}_{1;\domain} = 0.
  \end{gather}
\end{Theorem}

\subsection{Estimates of stronger norms}

\begin{intro}
  So far, we have seen error estimates in a ``natural norm'' defined
  as a norm such that the Lax-Milgram lemma holds for a given bilinear
  form $a(.,.)$. In this subsection, we now consider the question of
  estimates in stronger norms, such that the bilinear form is not
  elliptic with respect to this norm.
\end{intro}

\begin{Definition}{stronger-norm}
  Let $\norm{\cdot}_X$ and $\norm{\cdot}_Y$ be norms on a vector space
  $V$. We call $\norm{\cdot}_X$ a \define{stronger norm} than
  $\norm{\cdot}_Y$, if there is a constant $c$ such that for all
  $v\in V$:
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{v}_Y \le \norm{v}_X.
  \end{gather}
  In this case, $\norm{\cdot}_Y$ is called the \define{weaker
    norm}. If a converse inequality holds, the norms are called
  \define{equivalent}.
\end{Definition}

\begin{example}
  For a bounded domain $\domain$, the norms $\norm{\cdot}_{k+1}$ and
  $\norm{\cdot}_{k}$ are both defined on $V = H^1_0(\domain)$. By the
  Sobolev embedding theorem, there is a constant $c$ such that for any
  $v\in V$
  \begin{gather*}
    \norm{v}_{k} \le c \norm{v}_{k+1}
  \end{gather*}
\end{example}

\begin{Lemma*}{inverse-estimate}{Inverse estimate}
  Let $\cell$ be a mesh cell of size $h_\cell$. Then, there is a
  constant only depending on $k$ and the constants of the scaling
  lemma, such that for every $u\in \P_k$ there holds
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{u}_{1;\cell} \le c h_T^{-1} \norm{u}_{0;\cell}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Lemma*}
