\begin{Lemma*}{poincare}{Poincar√© inequality}
  Let $\domain$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any function
  $u\in H^1(\domain)$ define
  \begin{gather}
    \overline u = \frac1{\abs{\domain}} \int_\domain u(\vx) \dvx,
  \end{gather}
  where $\abs{\domain}$ denotes the measure of $\domain$. There exists
  a constant $c$ depending on the domain only, such that each of the
  following inequalities hold:
  \begin{align}
    \norm{u-\overline u}_{L^2(\domain)} &\le c \norm{\nabla u}_{L^2(\domain)}\\
    \norm{u}_{L^2(\domain)}^2 &\le c \Bigl(\norm{\nabla u}_{L^2(\domain)}^2 + \overline u^2\Bigr)
  \end{align}
\end{Lemma*}

\begin{proof}
  The proof exceeds the tools we have developed in this class. The
  proof in \cite[Section 7.8]{GilbargTrudinger98} seems elementary and
  direct, but is technical and requires star-shaped domains. The proof
  in \cite[Section 5.8.1]{Evans98} is more elegant, but it uses
  compact embedding and is indirect, such that the constant cannot be
  determined.
\end{proof}
