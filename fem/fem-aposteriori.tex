\begin{Definition}{a-posteriori}
  Let $u\in V$ be the solution to a boundary value in weak form and
  $u_h\in V_h$ be its finite element approximation on the mesh
  $\mesh_h$. We call a quantity $\eta_h(u_h)$ \define{a posteriori
    error estimator},
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{u-u_h} \le c \eta_h(u_h).
  \end{gather}
  The estimator is \define{reliable}, if the constant $c$ is
  computable. It is \define{efficient}, if the converse estimate holds,
  namely
%  with addition of a quantity $\osc_h(f)$
  \begin{gather}
    \eta_h(u_h) \le c \norm{u-u_h}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\subsection{Quasi-interpolation in $H^1$}

\begin{intro}
  Interpolation in Sobolev spaces in
  \slideref{Theorem}{fe-interpolation} relies on the nodal
  interpolation operator in
  \slideref{Definition}{nodal-interpolation}, which in turn requires
  point values of the interpolated function. Therefore, it is not
  defined on $H^1(\domain)$ in dimensions greater than one. Since we
  need such interpolation operators in the analysis of a posteriori
  error estimates, we provide them in this section.
\end{intro}

\begin{Definition}{locally-quasi-uniform}
  A shape-regular family of meshes $\{\mesh_h\}$ is called
  \define{locally quasi-uniform}, if there is a constant $c$ such that
  for every pair of cells $\cell_1$ and $\cell_2$ sharing at least one
  vertex there holds
  \begin{gather}
    h_{\cell_1} \le c h_{\cell_2}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Definition}{fem-neighborhood}
  For a vertex or higher-dimensional boundary facet $F$, we define the
  set of cells
  \begin{gather}
    \mesh_{F} = \bigl\{ \cell\in\mesh \big|F \subset\d\cell \bigr\}.
  \end{gather}
  Similarly, the set of cells sharing at least one vertex with $\cell$
  is called $\mesh_{\cell}$. Additionally, we define the subdomains
  \begin{gather}
    \overline\domain_{F} = \bigcup_{\cell\in \mesh_{F}}\overline\cell,
    \qquad
    \overline\domain_{\cell} = \bigcup_{\cell'\in \mesh_{\cell}}\overline\cell'.
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Theorem*}{clement}{Cl√©ment quasi-interpolation}
  Let $\{\mesh_h\}$ be a locally quasi-uniform family of meshes with
  piecewise polynomial finite element spaces
  $V_h\subset H^1(\domain)$. Then, there exist bounded operators
  $\overline I_h\colon H^1(\domain) \to V_h$ such that for every
  function $u\in H^1(\domain)$, every mesh cell $\cell$, every face
  $F$, and for $m=0,1$ there holds
  \begin{align}
    \norm{u-\overline I_h u}_{m;T} &\le c h_\cell^{1-m} \snorm{u}_{1;\domain_\cell} \\
    \norm{u-\overline I_h u}_{0;F} &\le c h_\cell^{\nicefrac{1}{2}} \snorm{u}_{1;\domain_\cell}
  \end{align}
\end{Theorem*}
