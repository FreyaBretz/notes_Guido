\begin{Lemma*}{poincare-friedrichs}{Poincaré-Friedrichs inequalities}
  There is a constant $c_P$ only depending on the domain $\domain$
  such that the Poincaré inequality
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{v-\overline v}_{L^2(\domain)} \le c_P \norm{\nabla v}_{L^2(\domain)}
    \qquad \forall v\in H^1(\domain)
  \end{gather}
  holds. Furthermore, there is a constant also denoted as $c_P$ such that Friedrichs' inequality
  \begin{gather}
    \norm{v}_{L^2(\domain)} \le c_P \norm{\nabla v}_{L^2(\domain)}
    \qquad \forall v\in H^1_0(\domain)
  \end{gather}
  holds.
