\begin{intro}
  In the previous chapter, we studied discretizations with
  $\div V_h = Q_h$ with two advantages. First, due to
  \blockref{Corollary}{galerkin-mixed-u-kerb} the velocity error is
  independent of the pressure. Second, the divergence converges faster
  than the gradient. A natural question arising is whether we can do
  something similar for the Stokes problem. There, the equation
  \begin{gather*}
    \form(\div v_h, q_h) = 0 \qquad\forall q_h\in Q_h,
  \end{gather*}
  would immediately imply $\div v_h=0$, that is, the discrete solution
  is exactly divergence free.
  
  The answer to this question is a current research topic. So far,
  beginning with the element by Scott and Vogelius, several methods
  have been proposed for special mesh geometry or macro meshes. The
  difficulty is balancing the condition $\div V_h = Q_h$ with the
  $H^1$-conformity of the velocity space. All the spaces in the
  previous chapter were only $\Hdiv$-conforming with discontinuous
  tangential components.
  
  A fairly simple solution to this question though can be obtained by
  using discontinuous Galerkin methods. These were introduced to
  obtain formulations \emph{consistent} with $H^1$ while not
  \emph{conforming}. Thus, we can apply them directly to
  Raviart-Thomas oder Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements to obtain a
  consistent method with divergence free solutions.

  We begin this chapter by a quick review of the interior penalty
  method before diving into divergence conforming methods.

\begin{remark}
  The extension of the interior penalty method to vector-valued
  problems is obvious. Furthermore, since the method generates an
  elliptic bilinear form on the discontinuous space $V_h$, this
  ellipticity is inherited by any subspace of
  $V_h\cap\Hdiv(\domain)$. Thus, we can write down the weak
  formulation of a divergence conforming DG method for the Stokes
  equations. In the following definition, we assume slip or no-slip
  boundary conditions, that is, $v\cdot\n=0$ on the whole boundary.
\end{remark}

\begin{Definition}{hdiv-ip}
  A divergence conforming DG method for the Stokes equations consists
  of a discrete velocity space $V_h\subset \Hdiv_0(\domain)$ and a
  pressure space $Q_h\subset L^2_0(\domain)$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:hdivdg:1}
    \div V_h = Q_h.
  \end{gather}
  Using the interior penalty bilinear form $a_h(.,.)$, we search for
  solutions $(u_h,p_h)\in V_h\times Q_h$ such that for all $(v,q)\in
  V_h\times Q_h$ there holds
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:hdivdg:2}
    a_h(u_h,v) +\form(\div v,p_h)+\form(\div u_h,q) = f(v).
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma}{dg-fortin}
  The \putindex{canonical interpolation} operators of the
  Brezzi-Douglas-Marini and Raviart-Thomas elements admit the bound
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:hdivdg:4}
    \norm{v-I_h v}_{1,h} \le c \norm{v}_1
  \end{gather}
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Lemma}{hdivdg-infsup}
  The method in \blockref{Definition}{hdiv-ip}
  admits the inf-sup condition
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:hdivdg:3}
    \inf_{q_h\in Q_h} \sup_{v_h\in V_h}
    \frac{\form(\div v_h,q_h)}{\norm{v_h}_{1,h}\norm{q_h}_0} \ge \beta,
  \end{gather}
  with a constant $\beta >0$ independent of $h$.
\end{Lemma}

% \begin{proof}
%   First, we make use of the fact that $q_h\in Q_h \subset Q$ to deduce
%   that
