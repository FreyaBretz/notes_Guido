consulted for more details on particular subjects. These are in
particular the books by Daniele Boffi, Franco Brezzi, and Michel
Fortin~\cite{BoffiBrezziFortin13} and by Alexandre Ern and Jean-Luc
Guermond~\cite{ErnGuermond04} on the general theory of mixed
finite elements, the books by Dietrich Braess~\cite{Braess97,Braess13}
and Philippe Ciarlet~\cite{Ciarlet88} on elasticity, the book by
Girault and Raviart~\cite{GiraultRaviart86} on incompressible fluids,
and the works by Douglas Arnold, Richard Falk, and Ragnar
Winther~\cite{ArnoldFalkWinther06acta,ArnoldFalkWinther10} on the
finite element exterior calculus.

\chapter{From elliptic to mixed problems}
We begin our course of mixed finite element methods by studying a
vector-valued elliptic problem. Then, we study its dependence on its
parameters and naturally arrive at a mixed formulation. We derive a
few properties of mixed systems and then turn our attention to the
first example: the Stokes equations of incompressible flow. We close
the chapter by considering mixed systems as first order conditions
for constrained minimization problems.

\chapter{Conditions for well-posedness}
In this chapter, we will first modify conditions for well-posedness in
finite dimensions from positive definiteness to the general case. In
particular, we will derive a quantitative formulation, which we will
study for infinite dimensional problems in the second section. In the
third section, we derive the inf-sup condition for mixed problems as a
special case.
