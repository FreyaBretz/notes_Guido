\subsection{Relation to constrained minimization}

\begin{intro}
  In this section, we assume that $a(.,.)$ is symmetric and
  $V$-elliptic. Therefore, the minimization problem finding $u\in V$
  such that
  \begin{align*}
    J(u) &=\inf_{v\in V} J(v), \\
    J(v) &= \tfrac12 a(v,v) - f(v),
  \end{align*}
  has a unique solution in a Hilbert space $V$, which then is a
  minimum.

  In the next step, we constrain the solution $u$ to a subspace of
  $V$, that is, we consider the minimization problem
  \begin{gather*}
    J(u) =\min J(v) \quad
    \text{subject to}\quad
    Bu = 0.
  \end{gather*}
\end{intro}
