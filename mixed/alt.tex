\begin{intro}
  This section of the notes gives a very brief overview over
  alternating multilinear forms, integrals, and differential forms and
  their relation to vector fields. It is inspired by \cite{Hiptmair02}
  and serves as a motivation for the usage of such objects.
\end{intro}

\begin{Definition}{alternating-k-form}
  An \define{alternating} $k$-form on a vector space $V$ is a map
  \begin{gather}
    \omega\colon\underbrace{V\times \dots\times V}_{k \text{ factors}} \to \R,
  \end{gather}
  such that $\omega(v_1,\dots,v_k) = 0$ whenever two of the vectors
  $v_i$ coincide.

  The vector space of alternating $k$-forms on $V$ is called
  $\Alt^k V$. The space $\Alt^1 V$ is the dual space of $V$.
\end{Definition}

\begin{Lemma}{alternating-k-forms}
  For an alternating $k$-form $\omega$, there holds
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Whenever the set $v_1,\dots,v_k$ is linearly independent, then
    \begin{gather}
      \omega(v_1,\dots,v_k) = 0.
    \end{gather}
  \item There holds
    \begin{gather}
      \omega(\ldots,v_i,\ldots,v_j,\ldots) = - \omega(\ldots,v_j,\ldots,v_i,\ldots).
    \end{gather}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Lemma}

\begin{Notation}{dual-basis}
  Let $x_1,\dots,x_n$ be a basis of $V$. Then we denote by $dx_1,\dots,dx_n$ the basis of $\Alt^1V$,
  such that
  \begin{gather}
    dx_i(x_j) = \delta_{ij}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Notation}


\begin{example}
  Let there be two alternating 1-forms $\omega, \eta \in \Alt^1V$.
  Then, a 2-form $\mu \in \Alt^2V$ can be defined by
  \begin{gather}
    \mu(v_1, v_2) = \omega(v_1)\eta(v_2) - \eta(v_1)\omega(v_2).
  \end{gather}
  This suggests the concept of an ``alternating product'' denoted by $\omega \wedge \eta$. In
  particular, we can assign to basis vectors
  \begin{align}
    dx_i \wedge dx_j (x_k,x_\ell)
    &= dx_i(x_k)dx_j(x_\ell) - dx_j(x_k)dx_i(x_\ell) \\
    = - dx_j \wedge dx_i(x_k,x_\ell) &= dx_i(x_\ell)dx_j(x_k) - dx_j(x_\ell)dx_i(x_k) \\
    &= \delta_{ik}\delta_{j\ell} - \delta_{i\ell}\delta_{jk}.
  \end{align}
  It can be shown that the products $dx_i\wedge dx_j$ with $i<j$ form a basis of $\Alt^2V$.
\end{example}

\begin{Definition}{wedge-product}
  The \define{wedge product} of two alternating forms
  $\omega\in \Alt^k\R^d$ and $\eta\in\Alt^l\R^d$ is a form in $\Alt^{k+l}\R^d$ such that for
  $v_1,\dots,v_{k+l}\in\R^d$ holds
  \begin{gather}
    (\omega\wedge\eta)(v_1,\dots,v_{k+l})
    = \sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \omega(v_{\sigma_1},\dots,v_{\sigma_k})
    \eta(v_{\sigma_{k+1}},\dots,v_{\sigma_{k+l}}),
  \end{gather}
  where the sum is taken over all permutations $\sigma$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    \begin{split}
      \sigma_1 &< \dots < \sigma_k,\\
      \sigma_{k+1} & < \dots < \sigma_{k+l}.
    \end{split}
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{remark}
  Alternatively, we can sum the wedge product over all perumtations of $k+l$ elements
  without restriction of the order. Then, we sum up similar terms
  mutliple times, such that
  \begin{gather}
    (\omega\wedge\eta)(v_1,\dots,v_{k+l})
    = \frac1{k!l!}\sum_{\sigma} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) \omega(v_{\sigma_1},\dots,v_{\sigma_k})
    \eta(v_{\sigma_{k+1}},\dots,v_{\sigma_{k+l}})
  \end{gather}
\end{remark}

\begin{Lemma}{basis-alt-k}
  The dimension of $\Alt^k V$ for an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$
  is $\binom nk$. The set
  \begin{gather}
    \left\{ dx_{\sigma_1}\wedge\dots\wedge\dx_{\sigma_k} \middle|
      \sigma_1 < \dots < \sigma_k \right\}
  \end{gather}
  is a basis for $\Alt^k V$.
\end{Lemma}

\begin{remark}
  The alternating $n$-forms on $\R^n$ can be used to measure volume. In particular,
  we have
  \begin{gather}
    dx_1\wedge\dots\wedge dx_n(v_1,\dots,v_n)
  \end{gather}
  is the (oriented) volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the
  vectors $v_1$ to $v_n$. The $n$-form $dx_1\wedge\dots\wedge dx_n$ is
  the determinant.

  Similarly, alternating $k$-forms measure the volume or area of oriented
  parallelepipeds of dimension $k$ in $\R^n$. But, while
  $\dim\Alt^n\R^n = 0$ and therefore the choice of a basis determines
  the volume up to a constant only, the dimension of $\Alt^k\R^n$ for
  $0<k<n$ is nontrivial, the area has the character of a vector itself.
  
\end{remark}

\begin{intro}
  Let $M \subset \R^n$ be a smooth manifold of dimension $k$. We
  approximate $M$ by a set of parallelepipeds $\cell_i$ of dimension
  $k$. Then, we can define an integral of a $k$-form
  $\omega\in \Alt^k\R^n$ over $M$ in the Riemannian fashion by
  \begin{gather}
    \int_M \omega \approx \sum_{\cell_i} \omega(v_{i,1},\dots, v_{i,k}),
  \end{gather}
  where the vectors $v_{i,1}$ to $v_{i,k}$ span the cell
  $\cell_i$. The integral is then defined by a suitable limit process
  for finer and finer subdivisions of $M$.

  It is clear, that in this process, the form $\omega$ may be
  different on each cell, which leads to the more general concept of
  an integral $k$-form $\omega$ on $\R^n$, which assigns every
  submanifold of dimension $k$ a value through the integral
  ``defined'' above.

  Looking at Maxwell's equations, the electric field $E$ and the
  magnetic field $B$ in the integral form of
  equations~\eqref{eq:mixed:maxwell:faraday}
  and~\eqref{eq:mixed:maxwell:ampere} are exactly such forms, which
  assign a value to each loop in $\R^n$, or more generally, to each
  smooth curve. Thus, they qualify as integral 1-forms in this
  context.

  As all $k$-forms can be constructed as linear combinations of the
  basis of alternating $k$-forms, we can define forms depending on
  position in $\R^n$ by
  \begin{gather}
    \omega(\vx) = \sum_{\sigma} \alpha_{\sigma}(\vx)
    dx_{\sigma_1}\wedge\dots\wedge dx_{\sigma_k}.
  \end{gather}
\end{intro}

\begin{Definition}{differential-form}
  A \define{differential $k$-form} on $\R^n$ is a mapping
  $\omega\colon \R^n \to \Alt^k\R^n$ of the form
  \begin{gather}
    \omega(\vx) = \sum_{\sigma} \alpha_{\sigma}(\vx)
    dx_{\sigma_1}\wedge\dots\wedge dx_{\sigma_k},
  \end{gather}
  where $\sigma$ runs over all incresing sequences of $k$ elements out
  of $n$ and $\alpha_\sigma$ is differentiable. More specifically, we
  define the spaces $C^m\Lambda^k(\R^n)$ of such forms, where
  $\alpha_\sigma \in C^m(\R^n)$.

  The space $C^m\Lambda^0(\R^n)$ is introduced for closure and
  consists of differentiable functions.
\end{Definition}

\begin{remark}
  The definition above extends naturally to coefficients defined on
  $\domain\subset\R^n$, yielding $C^m\Lambda^k(\domain)$. We can also
  replace differentiablility of $\alpha_\sigma$ by integrability to
  obtain spaces like $L^p\Lambda^k(\domain)$ and even Sobolev spaces
  $H^m\Lambda^k(\domain)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{Definition}{exterior-derivative}
  The \define{exterior derivative} $d$ of an integral $k$-form is
  defined such that the relation
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:mixed:k-forms-stokes}
    \int_M d\omega = \int_{\d M} \omega
  \end{gather}
  holds for any smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $k$. The exterior
  derivative on differential forms is defined as
  $d:C^1\Lambda^k(\R^n) \to C^0\Lambda^{k+1}(\R^n)$ by
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:mixed:exterior-derivative}
    d\omega(v_0,\dots,v_{k})
    = \sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \tfrac{\d}{\d v_j} \omega(v_0,\dots,\widehat{v_j},\dots,v_k).
  \end{gather}
\end{Definition}

\begin{remark}
  The definitions of the exterior derivative according to
  formulas~\eqref{eq:mixed:exterior-derivative}
  and~\eqref{eq:mixed:k-forms-stokes} are consistent by the
  \putindex{Stokes theorem} for differential forms.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  Integral and differential forms are fairly abstract objects, which
  gain their meaning by being integrated over their respective
  domains. Let us therefore relate them to functions and vector
  fields, also referred to as \define{proxy fields}.

  First 0-forms. We have already defined them as differentiable
  functions. Furthermore, 0-forms define integrals over sets of
  dimension zero, thus point evaluation.
  Thus, a form $\omega_0$ is related to a scalar function $p$ by
  \begin{gather}
    \omega_0(\vx) = p(\vx),\qquad \int_\vx \omega_0 = p(\vx).
  \end{gather}

  The space of 3-forms is also one-dimensional and can thus be
  represented by a scalar function. They represent integrals over
  three-dimensional sets $\domain$. It is known that all elements of
  $\Alt^n\R^n$ are multiples of the determinant. Thus, we conclude the
  relation
  \begin{gather}
    \omega_3(\vx)(\vv_1,\vv_2,\vv_3) = p(\vx) \det(\vv_1,\vv_2,\vv_3)
    ,\qquad \int_\domain \omega_3 = \int_\domain p(\vx) \dvx.
  \end{gather}

  The spaces of 1-forms and 2-forms on $\R^n$ are of dimension
  $n$. Thus they can be represented by vector fields $\vu$. 1-forms are
  related to line integrals and their proxy fields follow the scheme
  \begin{gather}
    \omega_1(\vx)(\vv_1) = \vu(\vx) \cdot \vv_1
    ,\qquad \int_\Gamma \omega_1 = \int_\Gamma \vu(\vx) \cdot \dl.
  \end{gather}

  Finally, 2-forms represent area integrals over vector fields such as
  \begin{gather}
    \omega_2(\vx)(\vv_1,\vv_2) = \vu(\vx) \cdot (\vv_1 \times ,\vv_2)
    ,\qquad \int_A \omega_2 = \int_A \vu(\vx) \cdot \n \ds.
  \end{gather}
\end{remark}
