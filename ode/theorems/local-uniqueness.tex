\begin{Theorem}{local-uniqueness}
  \index{uniqueness!local} \index{local uniqueness BVP} Let the
  assumptions of Lemma~\ref{lemma:bvp-derivative} hold. If the matrix $E(t)$ is
  regular for at least a single value $t\in [a,b]$, then it is regular
  for all $t\in [a,b]$ and the solution $u(t)$ is locally unique.
\end{Theorem}
