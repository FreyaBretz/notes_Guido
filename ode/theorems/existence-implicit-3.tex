\begin{Theorem}{existence-implicit-3}
  Let be $f$ continuously differentiable and let it satisfy the 
  one-sided Lipschitz condition with constant $\nu$. If the
  Runge-Kutta matrix $A$ is invertible and if there is a vector
  $(d_1,\dots,d_s)$ with positive entries, such that
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:implicit:cond}
    h\nu < \frac{\scal(x,A^{-1}x)}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^s d_i x_i^2},
    \quad\forall x\in \R^s,
  \end{gather}
  then the nonlinear system~\ref{eq:implicit:1a} has a solution
  $(\rkg_1,...,\rkg_\rks)$.
