\begin{Theorem}{b-stability}
  Let be $\left\{y^{(k)}\right\}$ the subsequence generated by
  B-stable method for the IVP
  \begin{gather*}
    u'=f(u), \qquad u(t_0) = u_0
  \end{gather*}
  with initial values $y^{(0)} = u_0$. If the right hand side $f$ is
  monotonic, then values $y^{(k)}$ of the sequence are uniformly
  bounded for independent of the time step size $h$.
\end{Theorem}
