\begin{Theorem}{fd2-maximum}
  Let $y$ be the solution to the finite difference method for the
  Laplace equation with the 5-point stencil. Then, the maximum
  principle holds for $y$, namely, if there is a point $(\mathbf x_k)$
  such that $y_k\ge y_j$ for all $j\neq k$ and $y_k\le y_B$ for any
  boundary value, then $y$ is constant.
