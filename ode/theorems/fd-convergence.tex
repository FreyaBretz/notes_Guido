\begin{Theorem}{fd-convergence}
  Let $I=(a,b)$ and $V$ according to
  Definition~\ref{Definition:bvp-second}. Let $u\in V \cap C^{p+2}(I)$
  be the solution of the 2-point boundary value problem $Lu = f$. Let
  $L_h$ be the matrix of a finite difference approximation $L_h y=f_h$
  according to~\eqref{eq:fd:8}. Let this method be consistent of order
  $p$ and stable in the sense that $\norm{L_h^{-1}}_\infty$ is bounded
  independent of $h$.
  
  Then, the method is consistent of order $p$ and for any right hand
  side $f$ there is a constant $c$ independent of $h$ such that
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:fd-convergence:1}
    \max_{0\le k\le n}\abs{u_k - y_k} \le c h^p.
  \end{gather}
