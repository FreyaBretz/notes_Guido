\begin{Theorem}{derivative}
  \index{conditioning!AWA} Let be $f(t,u)$ continuous in $t$ and
  continuously differentiable in $u$.  Then, the solution $u(t;v)$ of
  the IVP~\eqref{eq:derivatives:1} depends differentiably on the
  initial value $v$ and the derivative is given by
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:derivatives:5}
    \tfrac{\partial}{\partial v} u(t;v) = \fundamental(t;t_0),
  \end{gather}
  where $\fundamental(t;t_0)$ is the fundamental matrix with respect
  to the initial time $t_0$.
\end{Theorem}
