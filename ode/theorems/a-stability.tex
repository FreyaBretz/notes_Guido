\begin{Theorem}{a-stability}
  Let $\left\{y^{(k)}\right\}$ be the sequence generated by an
  A-stable Runge-Kutta method of step size $h$ for the linear IVP
  \begin{gather*}
    u'=Au, \qquad u(t_0) = u_0
  \end{gather*}
  with a diagonalizable matrix $A$ an initial value $y^{(0)} =
  u_0$. If additionally all eigenvalues of $A$ have a non-positive
  real part, then the sequence members $y^{(k)}$ are uniformly bounded
  for all $h$.
\end{Theorem}
