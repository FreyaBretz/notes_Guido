\begin{Lemma}{collocation-equivalence}
% HKW p. 212
  An implicit $\rks$-stage Runge-Kutta method of order $\rks$ or
  higher, with pairwise different support points $\rkc_i$ is a
  collocation method if and only if simplifying condition $C(s)$
  in~\eqref{eq:implicit:9} is satisfied. In other words, an
  $\rks$-stage method is a collocation method as soon as all the
  ``quadrature formulas'' involved are of order at least $\rks$.
