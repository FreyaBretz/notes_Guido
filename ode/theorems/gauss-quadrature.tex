\begin{Lemma}{gauss-quadrature}
  A Gau√ü quadrature formula with $n$ points is exact for polynomials
  of degree $2n-1$. A Radau quadrature formula with $n$ points is
  exact for polynomials of degree $2n-2$. A Lobatto quadrature formula
  with $n$ points is exact for polynomials of degree $2n-3$.
