\begin{Theorem}{derivative-f}
  Let $f(t,u)$ and $g(t,u)$ be continuous in their first and
  continuously differentiable in their second argument. Let $u$ be the
  solution of the IVP $u'=f(u)$ with $u(t_0) = u_0$. Then, the GÃ¢teaux
  derivative of $u$ in $f$ with respect to a perturbation $g$ exists
  and there holds
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:derivative-f:1}
    \frac{\partial}{\partial g} u(t)
    = \int_{t_0}^t \fundamental(t;s) g\bigl(s,u(s)\bigr)\,d s.
  \end{gather}
