\begin{Theorem*}{convergence-one-step}{Convergence of one-step methods}
  Let the one-step method $F(.,.)$ be consistent of order $p$ and
  discretely stable, that is, $F(.,.)$ is Lipschitz continuous in its
  second argument. Let $f(t,u)\in C^{p}$. Furthermore, let be
  $y_0 = u_0$. Then the method converges with order $p$ and there
  holds for $h = \max h_n$
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:convergence-onestep:1}
    \abs{u_n - y_n} \le c e^{L_h(t_n-t_0)} h^p,
  \end{equation}
  where the constant $c$ is independent of $h$.
