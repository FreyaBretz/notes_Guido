\begin{Theorem}{collocation-continuous}
  \index{Runge-Kutta method!continuous} The collocation polynomial
  $y(t)$, defined through an $\rks$-stage collocation method of the
  form~\eqref{eq:implicit:13}, defines a continuous Runge-Kutta method
  of order $s$. This means for the difference of the exact solution
  $u(t)$ of the initial value problem and the collocation polynomial
  $y(t)$ we get the estimate
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:implicit:15}
    \abs{u(t)-y(t)} \le C h^{s+1}.
  \end{gather}
  Additionally we obtain for the derivatives of order $k\le s$ the
	estimate
  \begin{gather}
    \label{eq:implicit:16}
    \abs{u^{(k)}(t)-y^{(k)}(t)} \le C h^{s+1-k}.
  \end{gather}
\end{Theorem}
