\begin{Theorem}{gradient-method}
  Let $F(x) : \R^d \to \R$ be continuously differentiable and let
  $x^{(0)} \in \R^d$ be chosen such that the set
  \begin{gather*}
    K = \bigl\{ x\in \R^d \big| F(x)\le F(x^{(0)}) \bigr\}
  \end{gather*}
  is compact. Then, each sequence defined by the gradient method has
  at least one accumulation point and each accumulation point is a
  stationary point of $F(x)$.
