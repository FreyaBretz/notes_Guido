  \defindex{stiff initial value problem}
  \defindex{initial value problem!stiff}
  An initial value problem is called \define{stiff}, if it has
	the following characteristic properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The right hand side of the ODE is \putindex{monotonic}, or at
    least admits a one-sided Lipschitz condition with a small
    parameter $\nu$.
  \item The \putindex{time scales} on which the different solution
    components are evolving differ a lot, or in mathematical terms,
    the Lipschitz constant $L$ of the right hand side is greater than
    $\nu$ by orders of magnitude.
  \item The time scales which are of interest for the application 
    are much longer than the fastest time scales of the equation. Again
    in the language of our parameters: there is a constant $c$ of
    moderate size, such that
    \begin{gather}
      \label{eq:implicit:7}
      e^{LT} \le c e^{\nu T}.
    \end{gather}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}
