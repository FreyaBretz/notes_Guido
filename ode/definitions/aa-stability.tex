\begin{Definition}{aa-stability}
  \defindex{A($\alpha$)-stable}
  A set is called \textbf{A($\alpha$)-stable}, if its stability region
  contains the sector
  \begin{gather*}
    \bigg\{z\in \C\;\bigg|\; \Re z < 0 \;\wedge\; \left|\frac{\Im
        z}{\Re z}\right| \le \tan \alpha\biggr\}.
  \end{gather*}
  It is called \textbf{A(0)-stable}, if the negative real axis is contained in
  the stability region.

  It is called \define{stiffly stable}, if it contains the set
  $\{\Re(z)< -D\}$.
