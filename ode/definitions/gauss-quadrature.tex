\begin{Definition}{gauss-quadrature}
  Let $L_k(t)$ be the sequence of Legendre polynomials mutually
  orthogonal with respect to the $L^2$-inner product on $[0,1]$. A
  quadrature formula, which uses the $n$ roots of $L_n$ as its
  quadrature points and the integrals of the Lagrange interpolating
  polynomials as its weights is called \define{Gauß quadrature}, more
  precisely, Gauß-Legendre quadrature.
