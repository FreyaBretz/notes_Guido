These notes are a short presentation of the material presented in my
lecture. They follow the notes by Rannacher (Numerik 1 in German)
as well as the books by Hairer, Nørsett, and
Wanner~\cite{HairerNorsettWanner93} and Hairer and
Wanner~\cite{HairerWanner10}. Furthermore, I used the book by
Deuflhard and Hohmann~\cite{DeuflhardBornemann08}. Historical remarks
are in part taken from the article by Butcher~\cite{Butcher96}.

I am always thankful for hints and errata. But please verify that you
have the latest version, which is available on github.

My thanks go to David Stronczek, Markus Schubert, and Dörte Jando for their help
writing and translating these notes.
