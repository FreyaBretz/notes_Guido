\begin{example}[Van der Pol equation]
  Given is the following equation:

  \begin{equation}\begin{split}
    \epsilon z'' + (z^2 - 1) z' + z & = 0 \\
    z(0) & = z_0 \\
  \end{split}\end{equation}

	It is also called Van der Pol equation. If one now chooses $\epsilon$ 
	very small, then one obtains a stiff IVP.

  \begin{equation}
    \epsilon z'' + (z^2 - 1) z' = \diffq[t] \underbrace{(\epsilon z' + (\frac{z^3}{3} - z))}_{=: y}
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}\begin{split}
    \diffq[t] y & = -z \\
    \epsilon \diffq[t] z & = y - (\frac{z^3}{3} - z) \\
  \end{split}\end{equation}

  \begin{equation}\begin{split}
    y' & = f(y,z) \\
    \epsilon z' & = g(y,z) \\
  \end{split}\end{equation}

	This is an example of a singular perturbed problem (SDP)

  For $\epsilon = 0$ we receive:

  \begin{equation}\begin{array}{lll}
    y' & = f(y,z) & \leftarrow \text{ordinary differential equation (ODE)} \\
    0 & = g(y,z) & \leftarrow \text{algebraic equation (AE)}\\ 
  \end{array}\end{equation}

	The upper system consists of an ordinary differential equation and an algebraic 
	equation. Therefore one also calls this a differential algebraic equation
	(DAE).
