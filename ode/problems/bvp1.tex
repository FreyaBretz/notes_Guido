Consider the differential equation
\begin{gather*}
  u'' = k^2 u,
\end{gather*}
with the two linearly independent solutions $e^{k(t-t_0)}$ and $e^{-k(t-t_0)}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transform this equation into a first order system for the vector
  $(u,v)^T$ and determine the fundamental matrix at $t$ for an initial
  value $t_0$.
\item On the interval $[a,b]$ consider the boundary value problem
  $u(a) = g_a$ and $u(b)$ for this equation. Rewrite this boundary
  value problem for the first order system in the form
  \begin{gather*}
    B_a
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u(a) \\ v(a)      
    \end{pmatrix}
 + B_b 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      u(b) \\ v(b)      
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
      g_a\\g_b
    \end{pmatrix},
  \end{gather*}
  and determine $B_a$ and $B_b$
\item Use Corollary 5.3.13 to determine whether this system has a
  unique solution for $a=-1$, $b=1$, and $g_a = g_b = \cosh k$. If so,
  determine this solution.
\item Use Theorems 5.3.10 and 5.3.11 to determine the maximal
  sensitivity on the interval $[a,b]$ of the solution $u(t)$ with
  respect to small perturbations of the boundary values $g_a$ and
  $g_b$ and with respect to perturbations of the
  right hand side of the form $g(t,u(t))$. Make suitable assumptions
  on $g$.
\item Compute the sensitivities of the initial value problem with
  $u(a)$ and $v(a)$ as computed above with respect to perturbations of
  the initial values and the right hand side according to Theorems
  5.2.6 and 5.2.8.
\item Compare the results for initial and boundary value problems and
  their behavior for $k\to\infty$.
\item Perform two steps of the single shooting method for this
  boundary value problem.
\end{enumerate}
