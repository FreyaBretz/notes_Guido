The beauty and the power of Galerkin\footnote{Boris Grigoryevich
  Galerkin (Борис Григорьевич Галёркин), 1871--1945, Russian engineer}
methods lies in their simplicity: replace the infinite dimensional
space $V$ in which the weak formulation of differential equation
problem is posed by a finite dimensional space , say\footnote{We will
  use the subscript $n$ as an indicator of discretized values without
  giving it a defined meaning. Intuitively, it may be seen as the
  dimension of the finite dimensional space, but later on this will
  not be sufficient.} $V_n$.
